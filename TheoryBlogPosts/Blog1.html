        <h1 >Library of Babel</h1>

        <p>
        Library of Babel’s reading was a bit hard to comprehend, it felt like I was reading actual babel. 
        However, after compiling the few English words I could grasp, I started to understand the reading
        and even started to understand a few of the points the writer made. Everything is infinitely 
        predictable. The Library of Babel starts with a description of a universe that is mainly made up of 
        libraries where these libraries are constructed of hexagons. Each of these hexagons have four sides, 
        two sides of these side are: for sleeping and the other side was accommodating everyday activities 
        such as using bathrooms and kitchens.
        </p>
    <br>
        
        <p>Based on my research, to explain how the Library of Babel works is that it uses up to 3200 characters
        to identify multiple of combinations that could possibly be made, through the use of number 
        increasing algorithm of one value each time. There is every possible combination of letters, words, 
        periods, and commas that exist in this library. During the lecture, it was mentioned that the cure for 
        COVID-19 has technically already been written and this mere idea of that actually being true blows 
        my mind. The internet behaves in the same manner, regarding algorithm, however it is not as mind blowing if 
        being compared to the library’s algorithm.
        </p>
    <br>
        <p>Is it because we are already used to how the internet’s algorithm works, and we are familiar with how it compresses all its possible information? Every 
        question I can think of or will think of, the internet can either pick up the whole question or bits and 
        pieces of it. Why is it easier to comprehend the idea that I am going to find the answer from the 
        internet to a question I have not thought of yet? However, the idea of having to find exactly what I
        wrote on this blog has already been written, in exact sequence, exact grammar error, or spelling 
        error is questioning and shocking. (See Figure 1.1 as an example)</p>

        <p>Internet and the Library are parallel to one another, they behave in the same manner and 
        possess the same characteristics which are that they both carry huge amounts of information, with 
        different variants and possible approximations. The internet is forever growing, the way in which I
        think it functions is that of reference of the past. The reason why I say this is because its information
        that started off based on what a user already knows, as users search for different/common things, 
        those get added to the internet’s algorithm based on past, common searches. Whereby the library 
        consists of information that is written of the future which has not even been thought of, not ever 
        been searched before. The danger and thrill that comes with this infinite predictability will never 
        seize to amaze me. The internet offers absolute surety and truth whereby the library offers 
        uncertainty with a dash of both truth and dishonesty.</p>
    <br>
        <p> In conclusion if I had to choose between the internet and the library. I would choose the library
        because of the infinite possibilities of the future in which it offers. In my second lifetime, I would 
        have been a librarian, searching through every hexagon, every shelf trying to find my truth. </p>
