    <h1>  Brief Implicit Association Test (BIAT-Patent Pending) </h1>

            The test starts off by giving a disclaimer about the proceeding of the test. It states that they are going to need specific 
            information of the tester and they ensure the participant that their information will be protected. One thing that reassured me 
            about proceeding with the test is when they stated that they use HTTPS, which banks use secure customer’s credit card information. 
            As upcoming web developer, I know that HTTPS is more secure with information than HTTP. Once the participant chooses to proceed, 
            they have an option of doing the test on a computer or a mobile device. Ideally you would a website to have those options automatically 
            built on the website instead of me having to select either computer or mobile test.

            The Implicit test uses its software to test a human being’s mind. The fact a computer is testing something that it led not have 
            access to directly, especially something that is not close to its form is quite innovative. The development of software has 
            allowed humans to test their mental state has made things in the psychology space. I have recently tested a ADHD test with my partner 
            and it’s isn’t as ‘complex’ as the anxiety test I took using the Implicit test. 
             </p> 
        <br>
            <p>
                In regards to the ADHD test, it was just a quick questionnaire where you had to quickly choose option a, b, c, etc. When it 
                came to the Implicit test, they wanted general demographic information about myself and they state that they going to be using the 
                answers to bring a closer prediction for the anxiety test. They use two factors which are self and anxious, with self they use 
                pronouns that relate to one’s self such as I, myself and me, when it came to anxious, they use words that are usually make a 
                person anxious such as frustration, fear, etc. They made these words pop up in order to either self or anxious, there were 8 of 
                these attempts.
            </p>
            <br>
        <p>
          At the end of the test, I got a result that I am self with calm over anxious. The test says that I was moderately faster to respond 
          when “self” was paired with “calm” than when “self” was paired with “anxious”. During the actual test, there wasn’t a display of a 
          timer but mentally as a human whenever you have to take a test, you would always assume that there is a time set for you to take the test. 
          However, at the backend of this test, it took note of the time spent in which selection in order to make this prediction. This just shows 
          the effort it took to make this test, in order to bring forth result as closely as possible to results a psychologist would make during their psychiatric test.  
          We are living in times where people can do their psychiatric test at the comfort of their home by using such softwares. Implicit tests such like this can create slight problems for 
          psychologists. A person can just take a test online to find out about their mental state instead of going to see psychologist. Software development is
          aimed at making life just a bit easier for the next person, however in this process it does endanger employment for another.
