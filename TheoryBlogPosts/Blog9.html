    <h1>A Digital Divide</h1> 
    <time datetime="2021/05/29"> Posted Tuesday, 25 May 2021</time>
<p> Author: Oratile Tlhabanyane</p>

     <br>
        <p>What is a digital divide? “The digital divide describes the gap between those who have internet access
            and computers, and those who do not” (Advancing Students Forward, 2020). 
            The haves and not have nots. It is the first time I hear this phrase “digital divide”,
            I thought it was some code division that occurs on the internet. However, that is not it. Digital divide indicates a ‘internet’,
            digitally division, it is a division that separates people that are privileged and those who are not. 
            There are not many people that have the privilege to the access of internet. Things that may seem as a simple thing to have such 
            as WI-FI, laptops and data are things that a subsequent amount of people around the world that do not have access to neither 
            of the above. How does this digital division affect me and the people around the world? Does it have any affect in the first place?</p> 
            <br>
        <p>The Advancing Students Forward article’s slogan is “education is the gift that can never be taken away”. 
            However, then came a time where the world reached a point where education was ‘taken away’. 
            Corona virus hit in March 2020 where the world reached a stop where people had to work from home and school from home.
            However, not everyone had access to WIFI, let alone laptops. This was a period where a lot of people lost jobs and 
            a lot of students didn’t have access to education. This was a time when digital division severely affected the masses 
            all around the world. The main reason did not have the digital resources to tackle the digital division is because of the lack of money to get these digital resources. </p> 
            <br>

            <p>Do not get me wrong, the digital divide did exist before the global pandemic,
                however the gap definitely got wider. Digital division now has ‘taken’ away a human’s basic right to education 
                and this has a large affect on the masses. Fortunately, I was one of the ‘privileged’ who had ability to access the 
                internet and have means, such as laptops and phones, to access my education which now took/still takes place online. 
                Digital division has affected, but in a positive manner as not only can I interact in remotely learning meaninglessly 
                but I am digitally literate. Whereby, there are some people in the world that do not even own a phone and are not as digitally literal. 
                Let us put aside the issue of a lack of access to the internet, a great number of people do not know how to navigate themselves on a laptop.</p>
                <br>
        <p>In conclusion, corona virus has shown the world a need to promote equality in regards to access 
            to the internet and focus on minimizing this digital division in the world. Digital divide does not only highlight privilege 
            but it also highlights the lack of economy development in multiple countries around the world. However, this gives room for improvement</p>
