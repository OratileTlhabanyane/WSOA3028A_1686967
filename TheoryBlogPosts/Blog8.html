            Geographic information isn’t about just detailing the statics of a specific area, the stats define the area. 
            A landmark isn’t just a landmark but it is an artefact that carries history of the area it is residing in, stories of 
            people that have experience the artefact and digital documentation of tit. Has technology somehow changed the way we view 
            geographic information. A physical map and Google Map could direct a person to the right destination but in this day and age 
            who still uses physical maps? Is it because technology has innovated so people are going forward accordingly or is it because 
            people trust an app more to be accurate than a physical map?
        </p> 
    
        <p>
            Maps, local escorts, or postcards explain portions of the world's boundaries connected with permanent structure that can actually 
            move around every part of the world.  Information of geographies based on mobile phones or devices does sway portrayals of spots 
            that are utilized both in the regions referred to and in different pieces of the world. This paper looks at geographic information 
            before the ‘invasion of technology’ but it also investigates how data geographies have their own geographic appropriations (Graham, Sabbata & Zook 2015) . 
            Did the information of geographies change as technology evolved? In my opinion, I do not think information changes just based on 
            the medium it is presented in. A group of people have contended that this arising computerized age offers a conceivably drastically 
            unique political economy of data. This paper analyses the local-scale geographic patterns of digital and internet-mediated processes 
            and platforms by using three topics: geographies of access and enablement, geographies of participation and geographies of representation.  </p> 
        
            <p>
                Geographies of access and enablement gives significant experiences into the circulation of advancements and administrations that are 
                fundamental for computerized correspondence and cooperation.
