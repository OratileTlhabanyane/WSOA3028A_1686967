    <h1 >The link between changing technology and the development and spread of internet 
        culture (including but not limited to memes and fake news)</h1>

        <p> Oxford describes technology as the “application of scientific knowledge for practical purposes”. Let 
        us simplify that definition, technology is taking knowledge mixing it with science to create tools that 
        will solve problems in an innovative way. Let us move onto internet culture, this can be described as 
        a culture that is driven by the connectivity of the internet. Moreover, these two elements each have
        an equal force and they both have a great influence in human interactivity [1]. These two factors
        have great influence onto each, as internet culture changes through time, technology changes 
        accordingly. 
        <p>Questions that raise here are: 
        1. Are these two interdependent or can they exist and develop progressively without one 
        another? 
        2. Is there a link between the two and if so, where do we see this link? 
        These questions will be answered and explored in the blog.</p>

        
        <p>There is a connection between technology and internet culture. The reason is because as society’s
        interests grow, technology grows with it. Vice versa, when technology grows/develops, internet 
        culture (society’s interests) grows with it. The way internet culture reacts to new technology 
        development will result either the success or failure of it. 
        For example, the development of the app TikTok quickly grew in popularity during the first stages of 
        the COVID-19 lockdown, society grew a creative culture of content creation from home that served
        as a form of entertainment and distraction to others and this culture was developed through the use 
        of the internet. TikTok created an internet culture that is easily identifiable, for example, if someone 
        starts dancing the CitiRokk, check link number 2 for reference, and as society that knows TikTok 
        culture, you will know that it is a dance that comes from that app. However, this internet culture is 
        exclusive.</p> 

        <p> Internet culture has brought the world together through the use of technology but not everyone 
        is included is this “connection”. One thing that the corona virus has highlighted is that there are ‘the 
        haves, and the have nots’, people who have access to the internet are inclined to know or be a part
        of the internet culture and those who don’t have access aren’t apart of the internet culture. 
        However, this percentage of the people that are not part of the internet culture don’t affect the 
        development of technology. Either way, it all boils down to numbers, if there is an internet culture
        and 20% of it was active there was not going to be a link between internet culture and technology 
        because of the lack of influence one has on the other. However, because there is a healthy amount 
        of society activity in the internet culture, there is a link between the two factors. 
        In conclusion, internet culture and technology are independent and can exist without one another. 
        However, for each to progressively improve in its element, they need influence from one another and other factors such as environment, 
        global economy, etc. Nothing in life can exist and be sustainable solely by itself, without getting help from somewhere.</p>
