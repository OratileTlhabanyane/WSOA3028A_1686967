        Being Black in United Kingdom is probably hard, imagine being black trying to live in a country that born and 
        breed your colonizers? In my opinion, they wont easily welcome black people with opens but they would probably use different 
        measures to make the livelihood of a black person just a little uncomfortable. There is a tweet that was made by a person under 
        the handle @elainebabey on Twitter which states that the British passport system “violated” her. See figure 1 for the screenshot of the tweet.

            Elaine’s mouth was closed as you can see in the picture but because she has big lips the digital system mistaken it as if she 
            has her mouth open. According to the Daily Mail article, there was a study that showed that facial recognition, that were popular 
            to use in the year 2018, discriminated against gender and race (“British passport website accused of racism after it believed a black woman’s mouth was open | Daily Mail Online” n.d.). Popular facial recognition services such as Microsoft, IBM and Face++. 
            In order for digital system to be discriminatory against women and particular races is based on the “standard” data that were set by 
            the authorities of the British. The data was set to represent all different skin tones, however all these of popular systems gave better 
            results to white, male faces. According to the article Microsoft was the only closest service that could recognize darker skinned females 
            and IBM couldn’t recognize them at all and only worked for 35% of the dark skinned females.
             </p>

            <p>
                Black people should be involved in the making of artificial intelligence, especially black women, to prevent systems from 
                being discriminatory against black people in general but even more often to black women specifically. How does a system say 
                that a dark skinned person’s photo is bad quality and that they must seek better if the data system was set to be inclusive? 
                It’s obvious it was set for humans with lighter tones and small facial features such as white people. In a world that uses AI 
                for basically everything such as job seeking, this prevents a lot of opportunities for black people.
            </p>
            <br>
        <p>
            A computer doesn’t generate algorithms that it hasn’t been told to generate and who puts in the data? It is the white male AI developers 
            that create such data that create algorithms that discrimate the minority. Simple solution to this? Add more black people to the data system
            development process.
