        <h1>A reflection on User Experience reading by Marc Hassenzahl and Noam Tractinsky </h1>

        Marc Hassenzahl and Noam Tractinsky start off their reading emphasising the lack of empirical 
        research about User Experience (Hassenzahl & Tractinsky 2006, p. 91). 
        Let us first define empirical as I am not familiar with the term. 
        According to an article on Emerald Publishing, empirical research is 
        “based on observation and measurement of phenomena, as directly experienced by the researcher” (William n.d).
        I think the key word in that definition is ‘experienced’ because user 
        experience is solely based on an experience had by a receiving end-user. T
        his reading focuses on three main perspectives regarding empirical research on user experience.</p> 
        <br>
    <p>The first perspective is “addressing human needs beyond the instrument” 
        (Hassenzahl & Tractinsky 2006, p. 92). To my understanding of the reading, it is basically observing
         beyond the act and analysing the aftereffects of the act and not the act itself, “an end rather than a means”. 
         This perspectives names multiple approaches authors that mention emotional usability, the importance of non-instrumental needs, etc.
          but Hassenzahl and Tractinsky state that with all these different approaches of going beyond the instrument, they have a common goal. 
          This goal being to enrich product quality to result in more wholesome and complete human-computer interaction. 
          The reason why I look this approach is because it highlights that the instrument that in conduction the act is 
          not what is important but instead what human user-needs does the instrument offer at the end.</p> 
          <br>
    <p>Moreover, the third perspective is emotion and effect. One thing I took note is 
        how it is important to make systems that are affective. Computers are machines and for them to react to human 
        interactivity affectively could seem a bit far-fetched. However, there is research that has proved systems knowing
         how to deal with human irritable emotions. Why irritable emotions exactly? Apparently, when humans interact with systems,
          they usually have negative emotions (Hassenzahl & Tractinsky 2006, p. 93). I do not fully agree with that statement, 
          as based on my experience with systems, I am not mostly interacting with systems when I have negative emotions. 
          For example, I could be posting pictures of a happy occasion and I will be happy when interacting with the digital media platform 
          ill be using. However, if this system (the digital media platform) does not provide great user experience which will result in negative emotions.
          However, the reading does elaborate about how user experience focuses on evoking positive emotions from humans (Hassenzahl & Tractinsky 2006).</p>
          <br>
    <p>Lastly, the experimental perspective which focuses on two aspects which are technology’s 
        situatedness and technology’s temporality (Hassenzahl & Tractinsky 2006, p. 94). This perspective was bit harder to comprehend. 
        They describe an experience as a combination of products and human states, whether they are expectations or different moods.
         These two combinations are interrelated and result in the actual experience. 
         This perspective is a bit complex as it explores the different explanations of experience and how it results into different outcomes of user experiences.
         However, one question that the reading states is if designers can make experience their design goal (Hassenzahl & Tractinsky 2006, p. 95). </p>
