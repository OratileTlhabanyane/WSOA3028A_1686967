    <h1>How does the Medium is the Message impact our understanding of the web?</h1>
    <time datetime="2021/04/6"> Posted Tuesday, 6 April 2021</time>
    <p> Author: Oratile Tlhabanyane</p>
    <br>
                <p> The web has become a space where it is free to all and gives some sort of power of freedom 
                of speech to everyone. However, like what Spiderman’s uncle once said, with every great 
                power comes great responsibility. McLuhan describes a medium as an extension of ourselves, 
                for example a camera is an extension of our eyes. So, taking McLuhan’s definition and 
                incorporating it with my opening message, the web is a place whereby whatever you share 
                onto there is an extension of your thoughts, opinion, moral values, an extension of you and if 
                you give off the wrong message on the web that is not “right”, it may destroy you. 
                McLuhan wrote Medium is the Message in 1962 but this reading still remains relevant till this 
                day. Could a medium carry more value than the message itself? In this age, we have become 
                creators of a few mediums such as tweets, memes, etc. The Internet/web being a form a 
                medium did not bring disconnect in messages that are shared among others. “We are too 
                prone to make technological instruments the scapegoats for the sins of those who wield 
                them. The products of modern science are not in themselves good or bad, it is the way they 
                are used that determines their value.” (McLuhan, 1962).</p>

                <p>The internet has been used as instrument for people to share their opinions, but these people 
                take advantage of the web as a privilege and use it for good. The web did not doom our 
                generation, the way we use it will determine how much impact it brings to our perception or 
                understanding of the web. 
                The internet is merely a digital extension of ourselves but however the way in which one 
                chooses to relay themselves on the internet will be of value more than your real self. The 
                reason for this is because the web controls human interaction to the point whereby some 
                messages cannot be understood unless it is said through the web. Human beings’ ability to 
                convey messages end up being dependent on the web and that we tend to focus on what is 
                obvious. McLuhan suggests that there are changes in our affairs that are forever growing. 
                The messages that were conveyed through the television is different to the message 
                conveyed through a laptop.</p> 

                <p> The change of messages happening because of the change of medium or simply the 
                medium is the message and the content really doesn’t matter? This understanding of the web 
                based on Medium is the message makes you wonder if the web were to evolve would the 
                messages conveyed and shared the web change? Yes. I don’t think medium is the message, I
                just think technology is inevitably growing and that cannot be changed but the messages we 
                share as people as time goes also grow and change. Medium may have an influence on how 
                the messages are received but the messages hold value by its own still</p>
