    <h1>  What are URLs and how do they work? </h1> 
    <time datetime="2021/07/1"> Posted Thursday, 1 July 2021</time>
<p> Author: Oratile Tlhabanyane</p>

            URL essentially stands for Uniform Resource Locator, to simply put it a URL is a unique address given to specific resources on the web. 
            These resources are elements such as CSS document an image on a page and even a HTML page. A URL is six parts to its address and there 
            are in this order: scheme, domain name, port, path to the file, parameters, and an anchor. I am going to be using this URL address to 
            explain how it works: http://www.aurora.com:70/path/to/myfilem.html?key1=value&key2=value2#HereIntheDocument
        </p>
 
        <br>
        
        <p>
            How does the URL work? The first part of the URL address is the scheme which is the ‘http’ of the address. The scheme indicates the 
            procedures that the browser, whether it is Google Chrome or many others, should use in order to request the resources, in this instance 
            for example it would be HTML page or CSS document, etc. ‘HTTPS’ is a secured and ‘HTTP’ is not secured. Moreover, the next part is the 
            authority which contains two parts which is the domain name and the port. The domain name is the ‘www.aurora.com’ shows which web server 
            is the browser requesting for and the port is the ‘:70’ is what we can describe as a ‘gate’, it is a gate in which is accessed to retrieve resources on the web server.
             </p> 
        <br>
            <p>
                The next section of the URL address which is the path. I think this is quite self-explanatory, this is a path to the resources that 
                are situated in the web server. The second last element to the URL is the parameters which are “myfilem.html?key1=value&key2”, 
                these just are extra stuff the server does before it give the browser the results of the resources requested for. The last component 
                is the anchor, ‘#HereIntheDocument ’, is “sort of "bookmark" inside the resource, giving the browser the directions to show the content 
                located at that "bookmarked" spot”(“What is a URL?” n.d.)
