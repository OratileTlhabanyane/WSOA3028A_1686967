    <h1>A critical analysis of your own UX and UI </h1>

            As a learning web developer, the first thing you want to get right is the function of the website. 
            The code that makes the website function such as HTML AND JS, CSS makes the website more user friendly and more readable 
            to the normal person. User experience and user interface seems like a step that a learning developer does not need to focus 
            on as they are still taking their baby steps in learning this web developing world and UX/UI looks like steps that experts 
            usually focus on. The reason for this weird assumption is that I thought a web developer should only care about how “pretty” 
            their website looks only after mastering their skill to code and make it fully functional. However, that is not it because the 
            earlier you know how to create good user interface and user experience, the better your web developing skills will be at an early stage. 
        </p> 
        <br>
        <p>
            My website is simple and quite easy to understand. I tried to have my layout and colours very simple just to make my user experience
            a little bit easier for the end user. I will be analysing my website’s user interface and user experience based on my past readings.
             </p> 
        <br>
            <ul>
                <li>1.	 In the past, my navigation was not good at all as my users found it hard to navigate through my blogs. I improved the navigation 
                by adding an easier access to all the blogs and other parts of the website on the header layout which is a common layout throughout 
                the website. </li>
                
                <li>2.	The website does prevent a problem from happening by including effective hyperlinking throughout all links on the website pages.</li>
                
                <li>3.	My website loads its pages really fast, so it provides efficient use to experts, especially when provided with good navigation. </li>
                
                <li>4.	My layout is very simplistic and minimalistic just that I do not overwhelm the user with a lot of unnecessary information.</li>
                
                <li>5.	If there would be an error that were to happen on the website, it would be in code, so I need provide the user a code written in plain language if they ever do run into an error on any page.</li>
                <li>6.	I would want to add a search bar so that users find what they are looking for easier making navigation a bit better.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <br>
        <p>
            My website still has a long way to go but it is slowly coming along where it will provide good user experience and a good user interface.
