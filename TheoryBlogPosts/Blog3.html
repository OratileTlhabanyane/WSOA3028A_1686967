    <h1 style="text-align: center;"> What is a browser? How do they work? </h1>
        <p style="text-align: center;">
            <time style="text-align: center;" datetime="2021/03/30"> Posted Tuesday, 30 March 2021</time>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"> Author: Oratile Tlhabanyane</h2>
            <article><p style="text-align: center;">I was watching a lecture that was uploaded on Ulwazi that was from last year (2020) and one of the 
            questions that was asked was “what is a browser?”. At the top of my head, I thought “a browser is 
            probably a platform where you search/scroll for something…where you can go and browse through 
            whatever content that platform you are on offers”. Computer Hope describes a browser as “a 
            software program to present and explore content on the World Wide Web” (Computer Hope, 2020). 
            Computer Hope goes onto to say that the browser can also be referred to as a web browser or 
            internet browser. In this blog, I am going to explore the different definitions of a browser, what can 
            be considered a browser and how does a browser work.</p></article>

            <p style="text-align: center;">Hope and Avast have the same or similar definition of a browser. Avast defines a web 
            browser as an application where human beings have immediate access to the World Wide Web
            (Bodnar, 2021). There are multiple examples of web browsers that are availed to us as human beings 
            such as Safari, FireFox, Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, etc. 
            However, is an app browser? During the lesson that I had listen to about HTML fundamentals the 
            lecturer asked the question “is an app a browser”. Yes, an app is a browser. The reason why I say or 
            agree to an app being a browser is because an app is defined as a software that is installed unto a
            mobile phone, computer, tablet, and many others. My understanding of an application is a software 
            that was created to make ‘browser access’ easier, it is still a browser, but it is a browser that is 
            designed to contain specific content, for example, you cannot search ‘how to make a cheesecake’ on 
            a Twitter app.</p>

            <p style="text-align: center;"> An app is a browser that is designed for better user experience. To know if an app is truly a browser,
            we need to know how does a browser work.
            A website contains of images, texts, and videos. The browser receives a request for information once 
            it has been sent by user and when that information or data is received, it will be displayed on the 
            user screen or window. This information uses what we call Hypertext Transfer Protocol which is also 
            known as HTTP. HTTP controls the way the browser displays text, images, and videos that are 
            traveling within the web (Bodnar, 2021). This information is firstly generated in the backend. What is 
            the backend? The backend are serves and databases that carry code that sends instructions to the 
            Internet an order for it to fulfil the requested data and send the results back to the user. 
            Whereby, the frontend uses a feature in the web browser called the user interface and this user 
            interface is where users can either scroll and click on the web pages that have been loaded during 
            request. How I understand is that the frontend is easily understood by an average human being 
            whereby the backend and its functions are understood by web developers. </p>

            <p style="text-align: center;"> In conclusion, the browser contains multiple features that support both backend and frontend 
            functions and these help people to navigate through how to use a browser when searching for
            information.</p>  </p><p><strong>544 words</strong></p>
