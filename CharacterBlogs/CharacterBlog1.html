    One thing I can appreciate about the internet is how it is made it easy for different types of people to connect. One can find their long lost 
    dad through a deep search on the world wide web. But one thing i really appreciate about the internet is having the ability to share my art. 
    I can easily write poems and share it for the internet to appreciate. The internet and technology has created means in which artists such as 
    myself, can use our artistic skills to create art digitally. There is software where artists can create digital potraits, digital lanscape paintings,
    and multiple other of digital artworks. However, has technology stripped the natural passion that comes with creating art traditionally?
    <p>
        I am an artist and one thing I love doing is being able to grab a drawing and use different shades of pencils to create a masterpieces. 
        The idea of feeling the paper as you use the pencil to draw the art piece, gives some sort of pleasure. Seeing the pencil residue on 
        your fingers and brushing off the eraser bits after correcting an error, the idea of physically feeling the artwork is like a drug. It is very
        therapeutic. Why I haven't really gotten into the feel of creating art digital is because of the following reasons: great art softwares are quite 
        pricey and working part-time as a waitress with limited amount of cash coming in, the use of these softwares is not an option. The second reason
        why I haven't resolved into art digitally is that I like the way I feel whenever I grab my drawing, already I am on my phone and on social media
        24/7 and drawing is my break from reality. My drawing pad is an escape from the world. Thus, going to draw onto sofwares doesn't offer the same 
        pleasures for me. 
    </p>   
    <p>However, these softwares have created an opportunity for many digital artists to evolve and create amazing art. I can even say that the internet
        has provided spaces such as Instagram and YouTube for me to share the multiple poems I always keep in my notepad.
