    The city life has never handled any sweet soul in a great manner. One thing about moving to the city of Johannesburg, it is that everything moves fast.
    From the actual traffic that occurs on a daily basis to the high speed internet that is offered. Access to internet is always a struggle for 
    the undeprivilidged and being a broke artist doesnâ€™t help either. I stay at res which is off-campus that offers limited data and if one wants 
    more data, you have to request for more data which means it will cost more. Living in big city such as Johannesburg does play an advantage
    to access to free internet. The reason for this because of the multiple locations and establishment that offer free internet to anyone, even spaces
    that are specifically availed to 'broke' artists such as myself.
    <p>
     Let's be honest, I do need internet to post my blogs for you to the enjoy and places such as The Hive in Braamfontein, Johannesburg offer spaces
     for creatives to be able to create freely. These spaces do not only offer free speed internet when you are a member but they also help creatives.
     become entreprenuers in their respective speciatise. For example, if you are a poet, such as myself, you want to release a poetry book. The Hive helps
     with offering "a range of workshops, masterclasses and access to business specialists".(The Hive, n.d) 
    </p>   
    <p>However, this space has been closed down because of, in my opinion, COVID. These type of places help us artists to develop and become business minded
        creatives. Though The Hive has closed down, living in the city, they are multiple other spaces such as The Hive that offer the same thing. There 
        are multiple opportunities in the city and a lot of options as well.
