<p> Author: Black Diamond</p>

<p>
    <p><strong>Why the character Black Diamond?</strong></p>
    <br>
    The reason why I chose the name Black Diamond is because it is my gamer's name to be very honest. I got during my first year in University
    when the class was playing a role playing game. I had stuck to it ever since so I thought I might as well use for character name.
    Black Diamond is an all rounder artist but the reason why chose her to specialize in poetry it is because is form of written art.
    This helps content creating for the blog as a whole. She works part-time and she is a student. I wanted to highlight how hardworking 
    my character is, even though she is royalt (which she doesn't know), she is naturally a hardworker because of the way she was raised.
    I also wanted to remove the stigma that visual artsists are lazy beings and doing art is quick cheat to not taking life serious. Artits are not
    lazy or self-absorbed. Black Diamond does charity work, this showing her humanty and she is a hardworking artist.

        <p><strong>Character Descripton</strong></p>
        My character’s name is Black Diamond. She is from a small town in Botswana called Kanye. She is 19 
        years old and has been residing in South Africa for 17 years. Her family exiled from Botswana 
        because there was a hunt for her family’s bloodline to be extinct. She is from a family of royalty; her 
        mom would have been a queen if it were not for exile. So, technically she is a royal princess, but she 
        does not know. She is currently studying at the University of Witwatersrand and is a waiter at a small 
        coffee shop in Braamfontein, she is doing this job part -time so that she can be able to pay for some 
        of her fees. She is a quirky, steadfast, driven girl. She has two tattoos, with a very healthy afro and 
        light brown eyes. One would describe her as a ‘soul sister’ with an Erykah Badu vibe
